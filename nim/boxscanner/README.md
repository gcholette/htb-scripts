# boxscanner

Must be run as sudo as it modifies the `/etc/hosts` file

## Development

Boot up a hackthebox machine and test the program against it.

Ideally use the `run.sh` script since it runs the binary as root (useful when nimble is not installed as root)

```bash
./run.sh napper.htb 10.10.11.240
```
